# Project Background

In recent times, India has witnessed a remarkable surge in credit card spending, reaching unprecedented levels and sounding alarm bells among financial experts and regulators. This burgeoning trend, accompanied by heightened concerns of potential defaults, has underscored the urgency and relevance of projects like our credit card approval model. As we delve into the project's background, it becomes apparent that our efforts are not only timely but also essential to navigate the evolving financial landscape in the country.

The latest data from the Reserve Bank of India paints a vivid picture of this surge, revealing that credit card transactions in India reached a staggering 1.48 trillion rupees, equivalent to approximately $17.8 billion, in August. This figure represented a slight uptick from the previous month's data, where spending had already reached an astounding 1.45 trillion rupees. The upward trajectory of credit card spending has ignited discussions about the consequences of this financial boom, especially as it unfolded just before the eagerly anticipated festive season.

At first glance, one might interpret this spending spree as an exuberant celebration of the festive season, a time when consumers traditionally indulge in shopping and festivities. However, delving deeper into the data and considering the economic context, the picture becomes more complex and concerning.

The surge in credit card spending is intimately intertwined with a growing trend of indebtedness and a decline in savings among Indian households. As families across the nation increasingly rely on credit to finance their purchases and maintain their lifestyles, it raises questions about the sustainability of this behavior. The potential for defaults looms large, especially if incomes remain stagnant, making it difficult for borrowers to meet their financial obligations.

One striking aspect of this trend is the demographic shift in the borrowing landscape. A study conducted by Paisabazaar reveals that young borrowers in India are entering the world of credit earlier in their lives. Individuals born in the 1990s, often referred to as millennials, have been at the forefront of this cultural shift. They are taking their first credit products at the tender age of 23, in sharp contrast to previous generations. For those born in the 1980s, the average age for the first credit product is 28, while the figure rises to 38 for those born in the 1970s. This generational shift in credit initiation signifies a changing mindset, with younger individuals demonstrating a more pronounced acceptance of credit as a financial tool.

While this cultural shift is not inherently negative, it underscores the importance of responsible lending and robust credit risk assessment models. As more young borrowers embrace credit, it is imperative to ensure that their financial well-being is safeguarded. This is precisely where projects like our credit card approval model play a pivotal role.

Our project is not only timely but also a proactive response to the evolving financial landscape in India. By developing a reliable and fair credit card approval model, we aim to mitigate the risks associated with this surge in credit card spending. Our model will not only enhance the efficiency of credit decisions but also uphold fairness and ethical practices in the lending process. By ensuring that individuals are granted credit based on their actual creditworthiness, we contribute to sustainable and responsible lending practices, safeguarding the financial future of borrowers.

In a nation where financial stability is intricately linked to access to credit, our project resonates with the broader narrative of financial inclusivity and responsibility. We are poised to tackle the challenges posed by this surge in credit card spending and provide a valuable tool for financial institutions and regulators to navigate these uncharted waters. Our journey aligns with the vision of a financially secure and equitable future for all, where the benefits of credit are realized without the burden of potential defaults.

As credit card spending continues to surge, our project stands as a beacon of responsible financial practices and an embodiment of the evolving financial landscape in India. With this understanding, we are well-equipped to embark on this mission, ensuring that the promise of credit is fulfilled without compromise.

## Label Encoding Knowledge

A Label Encoder is like a translator for computers. It helps computers understand categories or labels, like colors or types of animals, by turning them into numbers. For example, it might say:
   - "red" is 0
   - "green" is 1
   - "blue" is 2

We use label encoding when we have categories that have an order or ranking. For instance, if we're talking about sizes like small, medium, and large, we can use label encoding because there's a clear order from small to large.

Label encoding is handy, but it might not work well for all types of categories. If the categories don't have a clear order, it's better to use another method called one-hot encoding, which doesn't create any unintended order.

For Non-Ordered Categories: Imagine we have categories like "red," "green," and "blue" for colors. One-Hot Encoding is like giving each color its own switch. If something is red, we turn on the red switch (1), and the others stay off (0). It's great when we have lots of categories (like many colors) because it doesn't make things too crowded. It doesn't assume any order or ranking among categories. It treats them all as equals.

Remember, the choice depends on the nature of our data and what we want to do with it in machine learning.

## Dimesionality Knowledge

**Dimensionality** is like the number of knobs we have to turn when we're working with data. Imagine we have a big control panel with lots of knobs, and each knob represents something about our data.

Here are the key points:

1. **High-Dimensional Data**: When we have many, many knobs on our control panel, it's called "high-dimensional data." Having too many knobs can cause problems:
   - **Curse of Dimensionality**: Think of it as a curse where things start getting really complicated. When we have tons of knobs, our control panel becomes huge, and it's hard to manage. This can make our computer work much slower.
   - **Noise and Clutter**: With so many knobs, some of them might not be very important. They're like noisy channels on TV, making it hard to see the actual picture.
   - **Can't See Clearly**: Imagine trying to see a huge control panel with hundreds of knobs. It's tough to see the big picture, just like it's hard to understand lots of data with many features.

2. **Curse of Dimensionality**: This is like a warning sign that says, "Watch out, things might get tricky!" It's a way of saying that as we add more and more knobs (dimensions), things can go haywire, and our computer might struggle.

3. **Solutions**: To deal with too many knobs, people use tricks:
   - **Feature Selection**: It's like saying, "Let's ignore some of these knobs that aren't very important." we pick the most useful ones and leave out the rest.
   - **Dimensionality Reduction**: This is like using a magical tool to combine some of the knobs so that we have fewer to deal with. It makes our control panel smaller.

4. **Impact on Models**: Having too many knobs can mess up our machine learning models:
   - **Overfitting**: It's like our computer getting too obsessed with the knobs and trying to make sense of every little detail, even if it's just noise.
   - **Sluggishness**: our computer might slow down because it's working hard to adjust all those knobs.
   - **Confusion**: Understanding what's going on becomes tough with too many knobs. It's like trying to make sense of a super complicated machine.

In the real world, we want to find the right balance. we want enough knobs to control our data effectively but not so many that things get out of hand. So, we might pick the most important knobs, or we might use some magic to simplify things. This way, we can work with our data without making our computer go crazy!

## Label Encoding vs Weight of Evidence

Label encoding and Weight of Evidence (WoE) analysis are two different techniques used in the context of logistic regression, particularly when dealing with categorical variables. They serve different purposes and have their own advantages and disadvantages. Let's explore the differences between them:

**Label Encoding:**

1. **Use Case:**
   Label encoding is primarily used to convert categorical variables into numerical format. It assigns a unique integer to each category in a categorical variable. This technique is useful when we want to use categorical data as input for machine learning algorithms that require numerical input.

2. **Pros:**
   - Simplicity: Label encoding is straightforward and easy to implement.
   - It allows we to use categorical data in models that only accept numerical inputs.
   - It can be efficient when dealing with high-cardinality categorical variables.

3. **Cons:**
   - Ordinal Misinterpretation: Label encoding can introduce an ordinal relationship between categories that may not exist, which could lead to incorrect assumptions in some cases.
   - Magnitude Impact: The numerical values assigned to categories can imply a magnitude or order, which may not be appropriate for many categorical variables.
   - Sensitivity to Algorithm: Some machine learning algorithms may misinterpret label-encoded features as having an inherent order, affecting model performance.

**Weight of Evidence (WoE) Analysis:**

1. **Use Case:**
   WoE analysis is used in the context of logistic regression, primarily for credit risk modeling, but it can also be applied to other predictive modeling scenarios. It helps transform and assess the predictive power of categorical variables. WoE quantifies the relationship between a category and the binary target variable (e.g., default or no default).

2. **Pros:**
   - Encodes the Predictive Power: WoE captures the relationship between a categorical variable and the response variable in a logistic regression context. It encodes the impact of each category on the odds of the event occurring.
   - Reduces Dimensionality: WoE can replace high-cardinality categorical variables with a single numerical variable, simplifying the model.
   - Overcomes the Ordinal Issue: Unlike label encoding, WoE does not assume an ordinal relationship between categories.

3. **Cons:**
   - Limited Applicability: WoE is most useful in logistic regression and similar models. It may not be applicable to other machine learning algorithms.
   - Requires Domain Knowledge: Interpreting and selecting WoE-transformed features require domain expertise, as the significance of the transformation depends on the specific context.

In summary, label encoding is a general-purpose technique for converting categorical variables into a numerical format, while WoE analysis is a specialized technique used in logistic regression to encode the predictive power of categorical variables. The choice between them depends on the context and the machine learning algorithm being used. WoE is particularly valuable when we want to capture the impact of categorical variables in logistic regression models without assuming an ordinal relationship, but it may not be the best choice for all situations.

## Data Splitting Knowledge

**Features**:
- Think of features as the characteristics or information we have about something. Imagine we want to describe a fruit like an apple. Features could be its color (red or green), size (small or large), and taste (sweet or sour).
- In data, features are like these descriptive details. For a house, features might be its size, the number of rooms, or the neighborhood it's in.
- Features are what we use to tell a story about something. In data, they help we describe and understand what we're looking at.

**Labels**:
- Labels are like the answers or conclusions we want to find. If we're playing a game and trying to guess what's in a box, the label is what's written on a piece of paper inside the box.
- In data, labels are what we're trying to predict or figure out. For example, if we want to predict the price of a house, the label is the actual price.
- Labels are like the goal or target we're aiming for. They're what we're trying to learn or achieve using the information from the features.

For example, if we're trying to predict house prices:
- **Features** would be things like the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, and the neighborhood.
- **Labels** would be the actual prices of those houses—the answers we're trying to guess.

So, features describe what we have, and labels are what we want to find or predict. In machine learning, models use features to make educated guesses (predictions) about the labels based on patterns and relationships in the data.

## Data Scaling Knowledge

**MinMax Scaling** is like making all our data fit into a specific range, just like adjusting the volume on our TV. Here's how it works:

1. **Select a Range**: First, we decide on a range where we want our data to fit. Imagine we have a volume knob, and we want the volume to be between 0 (silent) and 10 (super loud).

2. **Find the Limits**: Look at our data and find the smallest and largest numbers in it. This is like checking how quiet and how loud our TV can get.

3. **Scaling Magic**: For each piece of data (like a number in our dataset), we use a special formula to change it so that it fits within our chosen range (0 to 10 in our example).

   - If the original number was halfway between the quietest and loudest (like a 5 on our TV volume knob), it becomes halfway between 0 and 10 (so, 5 on our scaled volume knob).

   - If the original number was, say, 25% of the way from quiet to loud, it becomes 25% of the way from 0 to 10.

4. **Benefits**: This scaling trick helps when we're working with numbers in machine learning because it makes sure all our numbers play nicely together. It's like making sure all our musical instruments are in tune before playing a song.

5. **Example**: If we're looking at houses and want to predict their prices, some houses might have prices like $100,000, and others might be $500,000. we don't want the difference in price to make one house seem much more important than the other, so we use MinMax Scaling to make sure all prices are within a range, like 0 to 1.

In the end, MinMax Scaling helps we compare and work with different numbers more easily in machine learning. It's like getting all our data to speak the same language, so our models can understand them better.

## logistic regression explanation

"LogReg" is a common abbreviation for Logistic Regression, which is a statistical method used for binary classification and, with some modifications, for multi-class classification problems in machine learning and statistics.

- Logistic Regression is used when we want to predict a categorical target variable, typically with two classes, such as "yes" or "no," "spam" or "not spam," or "fraudulent" or "non-fraudulent.
- Logistic Regression uses the logistic (sigmoid) function to model the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class.
- The logistic function "squashes" the output to be between 0 and 1, which makes it suitable for modeling probabilities.

**Mathematical Form**:
- In binary classification, the logistic regression model is represented as:
  ```
  P(y=1|x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))
  ```
  Where:
  - `P(y=1|x)` is the probability of the target variable being 1 (positive class) given input `x`.
  - `exp` is the exponential function.
  - `z` is a linear combination of input features, weighted by coefficients, and includes an intercept term: `z = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ... + bn*xn`.

**Advantages**:
- Logistic Regression is simple, interpretable, and computationally efficient.
- It provides probabilities as outputs, which can be useful for ranking or thresholding predictions.
- It can serve as a baseline model for binary classification tasks.

**Limitations**:
- Logistic Regression assumes a linear relationship between input features and the log-odds of the target variable, which may not hold for all problems. In such cases, more complex models may be needed.
- It's not well-suited for problems with complex decision boundaries.

Logistic Regression is a fundamental and widely used classification technique in machine learning, particularly when interpretability and simplicity are important. It's often used as a starting point for binary classification tasks before exploring more complex models like decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines.

**Assumptions of Logistic Regression**:

1. **Linearity of Log-Odds**: Logistic Regression assumes that the relationship between the log-odds of the target variable and the independent variables (features) is linear. This means that the log-odds can be expressed as a linear combination of the features.

2. **Independence of Observations**: The observations (data points) used to train the logistic regression model should be independent of each other. In other words, the presence or absence of an outcome for one observation should not affect the presence or absence of the outcome for any other observation.

3. **No Multicollinearity**: There should be no strong multicollinearity among the independent variables. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other, making it difficult to separate their individual effects on the target variable.

4. **Large Sample Size**: Logistic Regression tends to perform better with a larger sample size. A rule of thumb is to have at least ten cases with the least frequent outcome for each independent variable included in the model.

**Interpretation of Logistic Regression**:

1. **Coefficients (Weights)**: The coefficients (often denoted as `b1`, `b2`, etc.) represent the change in the log-odds of the target variable associated with a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable while holding other variables constant. Positive coefficients indicate a positive relationship with the target variable, while negative coefficients indicate a negative relationship.

2. **Odds Ratios**: Odds ratios can be calculated from the coefficients. The odds ratio represents the change in odds of the target variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable. An odds ratio greater than 1 suggests an increase in the odds of the outcome, while an odds ratio less than 1 suggests a decrease.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**: we can perform hypothesis tests (e.g., Wald tests) on coefficients to determine whether they are statistically significant. A small p-value (<0.05) indicates that the coefficient is likely not equal to zero and has a significant effect on the target variable.

4. **Model Fit**: The goodness of fit of the logistic regression model can be assessed using various metrics like the likelihood ratio test, AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion).

## Confusion matrices

A confusion matrix is a fundamental tool in the evaluation of the performance of classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and many others. It provides a concise summary of the classification results and helps assess how well a model is performing. A confusion matrix is particularly useful when dealing with binary classification problems, where there are two possible classes: positive and negative.

The confusion matrix consists of four main components:

1. **True Positives (TP)**: This represents the number of instances that were correctly predicted as belonging to the positive class.

2. **True Negatives (TN)**: This represents the number of instances that were correctly predicted as belonging to the negative class.

3. **False Positives (FP)**: Also known as Type I errors, these are instances that were incorrectly predicted as positive when they actually belong to the negative class.

4. **False Negatives (FN)**: Also known as Type II errors, these are instances that were incorrectly predicted as negative when they actually belong to the positive class.

Here's a visualization of a confusion matrix:

```
                   Predicted
                   Positive   Negative
Actual  Positive    TP         FN
        Negative    FP         TN
```

With these components, we can compute various evaluation metrics for our classification model:

- **Accuracy**: The overall accuracy of the model, calculated as `(TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)`. It represents the proportion of correctly classified instances.

- **Precision (Positive Predictive Value)**: Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions and is calculated as `TP / (TP + FP)`. It answers the question: "Of all instances predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?" High precision indicates a low rate of false positives.

- **Recall (Sensitivity, True Positive Rate)**: Recall measures the ability of the model to correctly identify positive instances and is calculated as `TP / (TP + FN)`. It answers the question: "Of all actual positive instances, how many were correctly predicted as positive?" High recall indicates a low rate of false negatives.

- **Specificity (True Negative Rate)**: Specificity measures the ability of the model to correctly identify negative instances and is calculated as `TN / (TN + FP)`. It is the complement of the false positive rate.

- **F1-Score**: The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and is useful when we want a balance between the two. It is calculated as `2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)`.

- **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: FPR measures the proportion of negative instances that were incorrectly classified as positive and is calculated as `FP / (TN + FP)`.

- **False Negative Rate (FNR)**: FNR measures the proportion of positive instances that were incorrectly classified as negative and is calculated as `FN / (TP + FN)`.

Confusion matrices are valuable not only for quantifying the performance of a classification model but also for understanding the types of errors it makes. Depending on the problem and its associated costs, we may want to optimize our model for higher precision, higher recall, or a balance between the two.

## Hyperparameter turning

**Grid Search for Hyperparameter Tuning**

In machine learning, think of a model as a recipe. The model has some settings that we can adjust, like the temperature and cooking time in a recipe. These settings are called hyperparameters, and they can greatly affect how well our model performs. Grid search is like trying different combinations of temperature and cooking time to find the perfect recipe.

**Key Steps in Grid Search:**

1. **Choose What to Tune:** First, we decide which parts of our recipe (model) we want to fine-tune. These are our hyperparameters. For example, if we're making a cake (model), we might want to adjust the baking temperature and the time in the oven (hyperparameters).

2. **Define Ranges:** For each hyperparameter, we decide the range of values to try. It's like deciding the lowest and highest temperatures we'll use in our recipe. For instance, we might say the temperature can be anywhere from 300°F to 400°F.

3. **Create a Grid:** Imagine making a table with rows and columns. In grid search, we create a table with rows representing different values of one hyperparameter and columns representing values of another hyperparameter. Each cell in the table is a unique combination to try.

4. **Bake the Cakes:** Now, we start baking cakes using each combination of temperature and time from our table. Each cake represents a different model with its hyperparameters set to specific values. we bake these cakes (train the models) on our training data.

5. **Taste the Cakes:** After baking each cake, we taste it to see how good it is. In grid search, we evaluate each model's performance using a measurement like "taste." This measurement is typically an accuracy score, error rate, or some other metric that tells we how well the model is doing.

6. **Find the Best Recipe:** we keep track of which combination of temperature and time (hyperparameters) resulted in the best-tasting cake (best model performance). This combination is like finding the best recipe for our cake.

7. **Use the Best Recipe:** Once we've found the best recipe (hyperparameters), we use it to bake our final cake (train the final model) on all our training data. This ensures we have the best possible model.

8. **Serve the Cake:** Finally, we serve our delicious cake (model) and see how well it does on new, unseen data (test data). If it performs well, we've found a great recipe (model)!

**Advantages of Grid Search:**

- **Thorough Exploration:** Grid search checks every combination, so we don't miss out on the best one.
- **Automation:** It does all the testing and tracking for we, which is handy and less error-prone.

**Considerations:**

- **Time and Resources:** It can take a lot of time and computational power if we have many hyperparameters and a large dataset.
- **Choosing the Right Metric:** we need to decide what "taste" means for our cakes (evaluation metric). Different tasks require different metrics.

Grid search is like a chef exploring various recipes to find the tastiest one. In machine learning, it helps find the best combination of hyperparameters to make our model perform its best.

1. **`tol` (Tolerance)**:

   - Think of `tol` as a measure of how accurate we want our answer to be. It's like saying, "I want the best solution, but I'm okay if it's not perfect."
   - When we're trying to find the best solution using a computer, it often takes many steps. `tol` sets a tiny threshold to decide when to stop. If the improvement in the solution becomes smaller than `tol`, the computer stops searching for a better answer because it's "good enough."

   **Example**: Imagine we're searching for the perfect recipe for chocolate chip cookies. we might stop trying new recipes if we find one that's almost as good as we can imagine (that's our tolerance).

2. **`max_iter` (Maximum Iterations)**:

   - Think of `max_iter` as the number of tries we're willing to give the computer to find the best answer. It says, "Keep trying, but don't try forever."
   - When we're solving a problem with a computer, sometimes it's hard to know exactly when we'll find the best solution. `max_iter` sets a limit on how many attempts the computer can make. If it hasn't found the best answer by then, it stops trying.

   **Example**: If we're playing a game of guessing where a hidden treasure is in a field, `max_iter` would be the number of times we're willing to guess before giving up (even if we haven't found the treasure yet).

In machine learning, `tol` and `max_iter` are like fine-tuning knobs that help we balance between finding a really accurate answer and saving time. we can adjust these knobs to make the process more precise (smaller `tol`) or faster (larger `max_iter`) depending on our needs and the problem we're trying to solve. Grid search helps we find the best settings for these knobs by trying out different combinations and picking the one that works best for our specific task.

## Cross Validation

**Imagine we have a bunch of puzzle pieces, and we want to know how good we are at putting the puzzle together.**

1. **Splitting the Puzzle Pieces**: First, we divide our puzzle pieces into five equal piles (let's call them piles A, B, C, D, and E). Each pile has roughly the same types of pieces.

2. **Puzzle Practice**: Now, we're going to do something five times, once for each pile:

   a. **Training Practice**: we pick four piles (let's say A, B, C, and D) and use them to practice putting the puzzle together. This is like learning how to solve the puzzle using most of our pieces.

   b. **Testing Challenge**: Then, we take the remaining pile (let's say E) and see how well we can put the puzzle together with those pieces. This is like a challenge to test how good we've become.

   c. **Score ourself**: we measure how well we did in this challenge. Did we complete the puzzle perfectly, or were there some missing pieces or mistakes?

3. **Repeat and Learn**: we repeat this process five times, each time picking a different pile to be our testing challenge and using the others for practice.

4. **Average our Scores**: After all five rounds, we have five scores. To know how good we are at putting the puzzle together, we average these scores to get a final score.

**Why Do This?**

- **Better Skill Assessment**: This helps we get a more accurate idea of how good we are at solving the puzzle because we've tested ourself multiple times with different sets of pieces.

- **Fair Evaluation**: It's like giving ourself a fair evaluation rather than just relying on one test with a single set of pieces.

In the world of machine learning, 5-fold cross-validation works similarly. Instead of a puzzle, we have a dataset and a model. we split our data into five parts, train our model on four of them and test it on the fifth. we do this five times, rotate which part we use for testing each time, and then average the results to see how well our model performs overall. It helps we get a more reliable assessment of our model's performance.
